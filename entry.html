        <p class="entry-paragraph">With the rapid advancement of AI we are seeing new uses almost at a daily rate. One the most viral of this new uses has consistently being music generation. The best example is the Bad Bunny feat Bad Gyal song, which caused great controversy after the singer criticized it. This leave us (or at least me) with a lot of doubts and curiosity about where this is going.</p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">In not long, anyone will be able to make their own songs, using an AI to write, compose and perform their own personalize song. This gives you the chance to have your own song about any topic you want, you can make a sad song by Ed Sheeran about how [insert which ever name] rejected you, or you can make a hype song about how bad [insert which ever name] fumbled the bag by rejecting you by Drake and 21 Savage. The door for hyper personalized songs is opened, you will never have to scroll through Spotify searching the perfect song that you can relate to anymore. How will this affect the music industry? This is probably impossible to answer with any degree of certainty, but we can at least try to make draw some comparisons.</p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">Imagine you could have a personalized, extremely well made painting of anything you see at anytime, just by clicking a button in a device small enough to fit in your pocket, well, as you probably already know, you can do this. Is called cameras. So maybe is a bit of a stretch, but allow me for the shake of this story to compare cameras with generative AI. Taking a look at how cameras change the painting industry and artistic scene maybe we can better know what to hope from the music industry and artistic scene in this next years.</p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">In some ways, photography made the need for paintings disappear. Why would I hire a painter to record this event forever in a graphical manner, when I can take a picture of it, easier to make, more accurate and more easily reproduced. Obviously, camera took a long time to fully develop, and this change was gradually made, not as black and white as I am making is seem. The art of painting had to evolve and change, transform into a different thing, as it was no longer needed as recording tool. It leaned more to its artistic side, becoming less and less realistic. Now painters could focus on the sentiment of it, on what feeling the wanted to show instead of what object or person they need to portrait.</p>
