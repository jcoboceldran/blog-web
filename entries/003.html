        <h1>The AI apocalypse does not begin with robots killing humans, it begins with robots entertaining them.</h1>
        
        <p>Maybe the title of this entry is a bit of an exaggeration, but it is almost indisputable that a major shift in society is happening. With the publication of "Attention is all you need" by _____, a huge leap was made in AI performance and usability. Since then we have witnessed plenty of milestones in the AI field, the most well known being the release of ChatGPT 3 to the public, which became the fastest "app" to achieve 100 million users. The given definition for an apocalypse by the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/apocalypse">Cambridge Dictionary</a> is "a very serious event resulting in great destruction and change". But what can AI actually destroy and change in human society?</p>

        <p>It might be hard to grasp how AI can really destroy or change anything with its current form. At the end of the day is just a program that takes some words and outputs some other words. If we want to get a bit more technical it can be elegantly defined as the mapping of any input vector (the words you input) to some output vector (the words the AI outputs). However, it is so much more than that, this mapping of vectors gets incredibly complex, and it doesn’t only match words to other words, AI scientists quickly discovered that this mapping works on almost any multimedia form that can be presented as a vector, including images, video, audio, etcetera. Now the possibilities for what AI can do broadens, therefore the chances of destruction and change do as well.</p>
        
        <p>There are many plausible ways in which AI can cause damage, but in my opinion the most prevalent of those lies within the realm of entertainment. Generative AI gives us the chance to create beautiful art (maybe art is not the best name for it, but least beautiful multimedia), so now everyone could paint their own painting without knowing how to paint, compose their own songs without knowing how to play a single note, write charming poetry without  knowing how to rhyme. And most importantly,  we could create compelling and persuasive narratives about topics we know nothing about.  Disinformation and misinformation are already hugely important problems for society. The new possibilities that Generative AI offers us will only aggravate these problems, in unpredictable ways, if we misuse them.</p>
        
        <p>To clarify, disinformation is defined by Sadiq Muhammed and Saji K. Mathewas on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8853081/#:~:text=It%20is%20defined%20as%20the,create%20them%20for%20political%20gains">"The disaster of misinformation: a review of research in social media"</a> as information that is fake or misleading and spreads intentionally. On the other hand,  misinformation is also the information that is fake or misleading but spreads unintentionally.</p>
        
        <p>So as I said before this is an already existing problem, but how does GenAI make it so much worse? To explain this I have to introduce a new term: “Deepfakes” described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake">Wikipedia</a> as “synthetic media that has been digitally manipulated to replace one person's likeness convincingly with that of another”, so in simpler terms, manipulating a picture, video, or sound track to appear as if it was someone else on it. This is a technique that is made much easier by modern day advancement in AI. The spreading of this allows for the mainstream public to spread both misinformation and disinformation in much  more detrimental ways.</p>
        
        <p>As <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/04/13/know-disinformation-address/"">different research</a> shows, we are clearly not ready for this problem as it was before GenAI, now it will be way worst. We all are susceptible, and we weren’t before we probably will be now. Many people get pretty much all the news from social media, especially the younger generation, and the older generation, which may be getting their news from some other outlets, but they are especially susceptible to deep fakes. Also nowadays even those other new outlets are spreading misinformation (because they are accidentally using bad sources) or disinformation (on a more conspiracional note, because they are trying to push false narratives). Either way this problem affects everyone in some way or another, as the truth becomes more and more hard to find between the lies.</p>
        
        <p>So how can this problem cause destruction and change? Misinformation and disinformation will only grow larger, in unexpected ways. “Reliable information is to civic health what proper sanitation and potable water are to public health. A polluted information supply imperils our nation’s civic health” said Sam Wineburg, truthful information outlets are fundamental for a working society. There are many examples, one of the most famous one taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
