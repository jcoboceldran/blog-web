        <h1>The AI apocalypse does not begin with robots killing humans, it begins with robots entertaining them.</h1>
        
        <p>Maybe the title of this entry is a bit of an exaggeration for dramatic purposes. But it is almost undisputable that a major swift in society is happening. With the release of the academic paper “Attention is all you need” a huge leap was made in AI performance and usability. Since them we have seen plenty of milestones in the AI field, the most well known being the release of ChatGPT 3 to the public, which became the fastest “app” to achieved 100 million user.</p>
        
        <p>Apocalypse might be too strong of a word, so let’s take a closer look at its definition. The given definition by the <a href=”https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/apocalypse”>Cambridge Dictionary</a> is “a very serious event resulting in great destruction and change”. So maybe the correct title for this post would be “The human society apocalypse caused by AI”. But what can AI actually destroy and change in human society?</p>

        <p>It might be hard to grasp how AI can really destroy or change anything with its current form. At the end of the day is just a program that takes some words and outputs some other words. If we want to get a bit more technical it can be elegantly defined as “The mapping of any input vector to some output vector” (input vector as the words you ask, and output vector as the words it answer). But it is so much more than that. This mapping of vectors is incredibly complex, and it doesn’t only match words to other words, AI scientists quickly discovered that this mapping works on almost any multimedia form that can be presented as a vector, this includes images, video and audio, among others. Now the possibilities start to get a bigger.</p>

        <p>Work in progess...</p>
