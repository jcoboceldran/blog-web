        <p class="entry-paragraph">A cyborg is defined as half human, half machine being.  A living mean whose powers are enhance by computer implants. A combination of cybernetic and organism (cyb + org). This term is often regarded as a science fiction topic, seen in movies like Robocop or Star Wars. This is though as concept of the far future, but, is this the case?</p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">Imagine a cyborg, a human enhance with computer parts to have a perfect photography memory, access to all of human knowledge in just a few seconds, incredible computing power to make any kind of extremally complex calculations, sensors to monitor any biometric, instant communication to any part of the world, and a number of other godlike abilities. And all of this without any kind of surgeries or invasive physical implants, only one or two devices that can be disconnected from your body at any time, and that only need to be charged once a day and it can do so while we sleep.  Would not this be an amazing deal? To have all this abilities, and just for a few hundred dollars. You probably would do it in a heartbeat, I most definitely would.</p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">Maybe you have already seen where I was going with this. Are we not already this described super human cyborgs? Do we not already have all of the previously mentioned godlike abilities. You can take pictures with your phone, you access the internet, you can use your calculator, or download an up for some more complex problems, you can measure your heartbeat, how many steps have you walked or how well have you slept, you can call or text to anywhere in the world. </p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">But, you might be thinking: "that does not count as being a cyborg, my phone is not a part of me". But is it not? When was the last time you went outside with your phone? How do you feel when your phone dies? How much time a day do you spend without your phone in your pocket, in your hand or less than a foot from you? Smartphones (and any other substitution technology that you can use for the same functions) have become an extension of us, they have become more important for your day-to-day life than even some parts of your body. Think about this next question honestly, give it a minute or two to really picture the hypothetical scenarios, and answer as honestly as you can. What sound more inconvenient, living without your pinky finger or without smartphones? Without your non dominant hand or without smartphones? Without your left leg or without smartphones? You might be thinking that you can get by with using Instagram on you iPad and WhatsApp Web in your laptop, also take those out. Thinking deeply about it what is your answer? Sorry about the gore mental images, I hope at least my point was shown.</p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">We have develop a complete dependency on this objects. A whole swift in cultural and social norms that revolves around these things and the new abilities we have obtained with them. There are very few things that can be done as of right now without the use of technology, and specifically smartphones at some point. I doubt there are many job opportunities for which you would not need to use internet or make a phone call at some point during either the application and selection process or on the job itself. You probably can not fulfill most of social needs without smartphones either. I doubt you can maintain many relationships other than maybe your direct family without some short of telecommunication.  How are you going to meet with your best friend if you can not text or call them? Even more difficult to get a partner and reproduce without it, how are you going to get to know someone if you can not agree to meet somewhere via message? Would they even trust you if you do not have some sort of social media presence? Maybe in some cases all of this would be possible, but is definitely not the norm. </p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">And we have not even begun talking about social media yet. To keep this story a readable length I will not get too deep into it. But I would like to talk about this image.</p>
        <img src="../resources/002/002fig1.png" alt="figure1" class="resource-img">
        <p class="entry-paragraph">Everyone using their highly advance cybernetic eyes to record forever the moment, instead of using their own biological eyes to do so. And the worst part is that this is not done as a way to be able to remembered forever the moment, it is done with the purpose of being posted on social media so that we can be higher in the unnatural social ladder that social media has created. But as I said before I will not get into this just yet. </p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">With all of this I do not want to make it seem as if I hate technology and think we all should go back to live as our grandparents did. I am definitely not saying that. But we must realize our complete dependency on this things and how they affect out lives. We must realize that all of this is not the natural way of life, and that this must be taken into account whenever any of our natural, real, and organic parts of life are affected by technology.  So maybe next time you are mad because your situantioship does not answer fast enough your text, or because you friend does not comment on your latest post or because your partner does not post you enough on whichever social media, maybe just remember ALL of it is fake.</p>
