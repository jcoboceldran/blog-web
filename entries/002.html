        <h1>Half human, half machine, cyborgs of the future. Or the present?</h1>
        <p>A cyborg is defined as half human, half machine being.  A living being whose powers are enhanced by computer implants. A combination of cybernetic and organism (cyb + org). This term is often regarded as a science fiction topic, seen in movies like Robocop or Star Wars. This is thought of as a concept of the far future.ut, is this the case, or is the concept closer to reality than we think?</p>
        <p>Imagine a cyborg, a human enhanced with computer parts to have a perfect photography memory, access to all of human knowledge in just a few seconds, incredible computing power to make all kinds of extremely complex calculations, sensors to monitor any biometric, instant communication to any part of the world, and a number of other godlike abilities. And all of this without any kind of surgeries or invasive physical implants, only one or two devices that can be disconnected from your body at any time, and that only need to be charged once a day and it can do so while we sleep.  Would this not be an amazing deal? To have all these abilities, and just for a few hundred dollars. You probably would do it in a heartbeat, I most definitely would.</p>
        <p>Maybe you have already seen where I was going with this. Are we not already these super human cyborgs described? Do we not already have all of the previously mentioned godlike abilities? You can take pictures with your phone, you access the internet, you can use your calculator, you can measure your heartbeat, how many steps have you walked or how well have you slept, you can call or text anywhere in the world. All of this with smartphones, which nowadays start for less than two hundred dollars.</p>
        <p>You might be thinking: ***that does not count as being a cyborg, my phone is not a part of me***. But is it not? When was the last time you went outside with your phone? How do you feel when your phone dies? How much time a day do you spend without your phone in your pocket, in your hand or less than a foot from you? Smartphones (and any other substitution technology that you can use for the same functions) have become an extension of us, they have become more important for your day-to-day life than even some parts of your body. Think about this next question honestly, give it a minute or two to really picture the hypothetical scenarios, and answer as honestly as you can. What sounds more inconvenient, living without your pinky finger or without smartphones? Without your non-dominant hand or without smartphones? Without your left leg or without smartphones? You might be thinking that you can get by with using Instagram on your iPad and WhatsApp Web in your laptop, also take those out. Thinking deeply about it, what is your answer? Sorry about the gore mental images, I hope at least my point was shown.</p>
        <p>We have developed a complete dependency on these objects. A whole swift in cultural and social norms that revolves around these things and the new abilities we have obtained with them. There are very few things that can be done as of right now without the use of technology, and specifically smartphones at some point. I doubt there are many job opportunities for which you would not need to use the internet or make a phone call at some point during either the application and selection process or on the job itself. You probably can not fulfill most of your social needs without smartphones either. I doubt you can maintain many relationships other than maybe your direct family without some short of telecommunication. How are you going to meet with your best friend if you can not text or call them? Even more difficult to get a partner and reproduce without it, how are you going to get to know someone if you can not agree to meet somewhere via message? Would they even trust you if you do not have some sort of social media presence? Maybe in some cases all of this would be possible, but is definitely not the norm.</p>
        <p>We depend on our cybernetic body extensions for various tasks, some of which we could perform manually. However, we still opt to use our smartphones for these activities (more often than not for social media reasons).</p>

        <p>In this image of New Year’s in Paris we see a clear example. We chose to see with our phones instead with our eyes. We choose to use our artificial memory to record the moment instead of our natural memory, even though the later one would offer much more information about the moment. We rather create digital pieces of multimedia than a memory filled with nuances and little details that a smartphone camera would never capture.</p>
        <p>With that being said, I do not want to make it seem as if I hate technology and think we all should go back to live as our grandparents and those before us did. I am definitely not saying that, but we must realize our complete dependency on these things and how they affect our lives. We must realize that all of this is an unnatural way of life, and that this must be taken into account whenever any of our natural, real, and organic parts of life are affected by technology.  So maybe next time you are mad because your situationship does not answer your text fast enough, or because your friend does not comment on your latest post, or your partner does not post you enough on whichever social media, maybe just try to that remember our Upper Paleolithic era brains have not evolved to deal with this Artificial Intelligence era society.</p>
