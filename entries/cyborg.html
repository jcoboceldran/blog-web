        <p class="entry-paragraph">A cyborg is defined as half human, half machine being.  A living mean whose powers are enhance by computer implants. A combination of cybernetic and organism (cyb + org). This term is often regarded as a science fiction topic, seen in movies like Robocop or Star Wars. This is though as concept of the far future, but, is this the case?A cyborg is defined as half human, half machine being.  A living mean whose powers are enhance by computer implants. A combination of cybernetic and organism (cyb + org). This term is often regarded as a science fiction topic, seen in movies like Robocop or Star Wars. This is though as concept of the far future, but, is this the case?</p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">Imagine a cyborg, a human enhance with computer parts to have a perfect photography memory, access to all of human knowledge in just a few seconds, incredible computing power to make any kind of extremally complex calculations, sensors to monitor any biometric, instant communication to any part of the world, and a number of other godlike abilities. And all of this without any kind of surgeries or invasive physical implants, only one or two devices that can be disconnected from your body at any time, and that only need to be charged once a day and it can do so while we sleep.  Would not this be an amazing deal? To have all this abilities, and just for a few hundred dollars. You probably would do it in a heartbeat, I most definitely would.</p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">Maybe you have already seen where I was going with this. Are we not already this described super human cyborgs? Do we not already have all of the previously mentioned godlike abilities. You can take pictures with your phone, you access the internet, you can use your calculator, or download an up for some more complex problems, you can measure your heartbeat, how many steps have you walked or how well have you slept, you can call or text to anywhere in the world. </p>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">But, you might be thinking: "that does not count as being a cyborg, my phone is not a part of me". But is it not? When was the last time you went outside with your phone? How do you feel when your phone dies? How much time a day do you spend without your phone in your pocket, in your hand or less than a foot from you? Smartphones (and any other substitution technology that you can use for the same functions) have become an extension of us, they have become more important for your day-to-day life than even some parts of your body. Think about this next question honestly, give it a minute or two to really picture the hypothetical scenarios, and answer as honestly as you can. What sound more inconvenient, living without your pinky finger or without smartphones? Without your non dominant hand or without smartphones? Without your left leg or without smartphones? You might be thinking that you can get by with using Instagram on you iPad and WhatsApp Web in your laptop, also take those out. Thinking deeply about it what is your answer? Sorry about the gore mental images, I hope at least my point was shown.</p>
