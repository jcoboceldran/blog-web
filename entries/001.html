        <h1>AI will be to the music industry what the camera was to the painting industry.</h1>
        <p>With the rapid advancement of AI we are seeing new uses almost at a daily rate. One the most viral of this new uses has consistently being music generation. The best example is the Bad Bunny feat Bad Gyal song, which caused great controversy after the singer criticized it. This leave us (or at least me) with a lot of doubts and curiosity about where this is going.</p>
        <p>In not long, anyone will be able to make their own songs, using an AI to write, compose and perform their own personalize song. This gives you the chance to have your own song about any topic you want, you can make a sad song by Ed Sheeran about how [insert which ever name] rejected you, or you can make a hype song about how bad [insert which ever name] fumbled the bag by rejecting you by Drake and 21 Savage. The door for hyper personalized songs is opened, you will never have to scroll through Spotify searching the perfect song that you can relate to anymore. How will this affect the music industry? This is probably impossible to answer with any degree of certainty, but we can at least try to make draw some comparisons.</p>
        <p>Imagine you could have a personalized, extremely well made painting of anything you see at anytime, just by clicking a button in a device small enough to fit in your pocket, well, as you probably already know, you can do this. Is called cameras. So maybe is a bit of a stretch, but allow me for the shake of this story to compare cameras with generative AI. Taking a look at how cameras change the painting industry and artistic scene maybe we can better know what to hope from the music industry and artistic scene in this next years.</p>
        <p>In some ways, photography made the need for paintings disappear. Why would I hire a painter to record this event forever in a graphical manner, when I can take a picture of it, easier to make, more accurate and more easily reproduced. Obviously, camera took a long time to fully develop, and this change was gradually made, not as black and white as I am making is seem. The art of painting had to evolve and change, transform into a different thing, as it was no longer needed as recording tool. It leaned more to its artistic side, becoming less and less realistic. Now painters could focus on the sentiment of it, on what feeling the wanted to show instead of what object or person they need to portrait.</p>
        <p>Bellow you can see a timeline with the biggest art trends and their most famous representation, do you think you could pin point the time when cameras where popularized and made? </p>
        <p>Obviously something happened between Realism and Impressionism, although cameras where officially invented some years between this change in trends (is hard to pin point this kind of dates exactly, but is about a 40-50 year difference), you can clearly see the effect that cameras had on paintings. Finally, as the cherry on the top, the last painting included  ("Marilyn Diptych") actually incorporates photography techniques into the art.</p>
        <p>So now the questions we are left with are, will something similar happen to music? And what would that look like? Although we can't possibly now for sure, speculating is harmless. I think there is a very high chance something similar will happen to music, in the way of a radical artistic trends transition. Maybe Hip-hop is the last "realistic" genre we got, as happened to Realism in paintings.</p>
        <p>So what does the future of music sound like? Maybe we strive away from lyrics all together, leaving that to the AIs, and we go into a purely instrumental (of course instruments played/created/assisted by AI) tracks. Music where all that matters is what it makes you feel, maybe se start to see museums of music, where artists can design a whole ambient for their songs. Of course, I don't think music as we know it today will disappear, but I do think there is a chance that in a few years the music we consume as entertainment rather than art will be produced by an AI following our directions.</p>
        <p>Another thing I haven't taken into account yet are the voices. The current AIs borrow (or steal) their voices from already stablished artists. I see this going two ways. Either the AIs evolve to also allow you to create the voice you want with high tunning and precision. Or, on a more dystopian note, artists will "sell" their voices. To keep going the similarities to cameras, we can think of buying a better camera to get better pictures, well, maybe you can buy better voices to get better songs. Also it comes to mind the idea of filters, we can apply filters to our pictures to get different artistic styles. Maybe the AI music comes with a "default" voice and you can apply a some filters to it to make however you want.</p>
